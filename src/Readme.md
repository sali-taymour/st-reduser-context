## What we will build:
a React website (Vite) reads an array of flashcards from the API backend
buttons enable you to delete, edit and add flashcards
these actions are managed by a useReducer that is in a useContext
## How we will build it
first we will build a simple solution of a counter with useContext
then we will convert the counter to a useReducer
then we will add actions which manage the add, delete and edit buttons
## What we will use
React (Vite)
useContext
useReducer
